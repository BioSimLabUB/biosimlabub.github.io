Excited to share our lab first published paper spearheaded by Hiranmay and Peter on [J Phys Chem Lett](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c01656). We demonstrated that the ion clouds of unstructured RNAs extend further in the solution than those of folded domains, suggesting a role for disordered RNA to be a recruiter using long-ranged interactions. :tada:
