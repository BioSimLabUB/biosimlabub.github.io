Check out our new preprint on [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.31.596852v1), which is a collaborative effort with the Trcek's and other labs. We showed that mRNA retains most of its structure inside germ granule, and that RNA-RNA homotypic interactions are limited, and are mostly formed by scattered intermolecular base pairing.
