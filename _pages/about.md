Welcome to the BioSim lab at the [Department of Chemistry - University of Buffalo](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/chemistry.html)! Our team of researchers, led by [Hung Nguyen, Ph.D.](/members/PI), specializes in developing and applying **computational methods & tools** to study biological systems at the molecular level. By combining expertise in chemistry, biophysics, polymer physics & molecular biology, we aim to uncover the **fundamental principles** underlying the behavior of biomolecules, their interactions and functions. Our ultimate goal is to advance our understanding of biological processes and contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches.
