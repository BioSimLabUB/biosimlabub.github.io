## Short Bio

I obtained my bachelor of science degree in biochemistry from Gettysburg College in the historical town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. I really enjoyed living and studying in a historical small town, and the Gettysburg battlefield was perfect for a nice evening stroll. 

While in college, I completed four years of undergraduate research through the Cross-Disciplinary Science Institute (X-Sig, https://www.gettysburg.edu/offices/cross-disciplinary-science-institute) in a range of research areas, including organic synthesis, lipid biophysics, and atomic force microscopy. 

At UB, I am very excited to be one of the first students joining the UB BioSim Lab. I am interested in developing computational methods to model and predict the behavior of our biomolecules of interest. Working collaboratively, I hope we can start to unravel the intricate connections between biomolecular behaviors and the onset and progression of diseases. Outside of research, I enjoy long-distance running, playing with my cat (Hope), and traveling.
