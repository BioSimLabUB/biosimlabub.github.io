## Short Bio

I completed my undergraduate studies at UB with a major in Chemistry and a minor in Philosophy. I have really enjoyed my learning experience here. During my time in the lab as an undergrad, my research focused on studying various types of inorganic complexes and their potential for further development as contrast agents.  

In my graduate career, I am very excited to join and work in the BioSim Lab where I will get the opportunity to combine my interest in Chemistry and Computational Science to study molecular systems. I also like to continue to explore the city of Buffalo and the greater WNY area during these years.
