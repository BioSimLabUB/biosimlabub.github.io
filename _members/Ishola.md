## Short Bio

I earned my undergraduate degree in Industrial Chemistry from the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA), Nigeria. Subsequently, I completed a master's degree in Chemoinformatics at the University of Strasbourg, France. In 2024, I had the privilege of interning with the Computational Algorithms for Protein Structures and Interactions (CAPSID) team at Inria, CNRS, and the University of Lorraine, where my research explored the conformational dynamics of the spike trimer.

Beyond academics, I am passionate about travelling across Europe, embracing its rich cultural diversity and enjoying its multicultural experiences.

I am thrilled to join the BioSim Lab at UB, where I aim to focus on studying intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) using computational models. Their dynamic and flexible nature presents unique challenges for experimental techniques, making computational approaches especially valuable and fascinating to explore.
