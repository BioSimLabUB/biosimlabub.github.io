## Short Bio

After completing my MSc in Physics from Calcutta University, I joined the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) as a PhD candidate. Under the supervision of Prof. Debaprasad Giri and with additional guidance from Prof. Sanjay Kumar, I submitted my PhD thesis, "Behaviour of Biopolymers Under Confinement," in December 2021. During my PhD, I studied the equilibrium statistics of polymers and DNA subjected to various confinements, motivated by several biological phenomena such as DNA thermophoresis, entropic trapping of DNA, DNA adsorption, and the ejection of DNA from viral capsids.

After that, I spent six months at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai, working on repulsion-induced heteropolymer collapse. Subsequently, I joined Dr. Tobias Ambj√∂rnsson's group (2022-2024) at the Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences, Lund University, where I broadly developed software to help identify bacterial DNA species from fluorescence images of DNA.

In Biosimlab, which I joined in August 2024, I will be working on the thermodynamics of RNA folding.
