## Short Bio

I completed my PhD from the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India. My doctoral research explores the conformational transitions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) under the influence of intrinsic factors (e.g., chain length, amino acid composition, sequence) and external conditions such as salts, pH, denaturants, osmolytes, and ions and their implication for liquid-liquid phase separation.

At the University at Buffalo, my research centers on developing computational models for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and ribonucleic acids (RNA). My aim is to investigate how changes in cellular environments—such as variations in salt concentration, pH and temperature—affect the formation and function of biomolecular condensates.
