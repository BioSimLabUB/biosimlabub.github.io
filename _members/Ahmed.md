## Short Bio

I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka. As an undergraduate researcher during this time, I developed a differential equation model for cell-free protein synthesis. This model was designed to guide the planning of wet-lab experiments, with the goal of optimizing yield and efficiency.
 
At UB, I joined the Biological Simulations Lab to deepen my understanding of condensate formation. My current research focuses on exploring the physical and chemical principles underlying biomolecular condensates. By employing computational modeling and simulations, I aim to uncover how these structures form, regulate biochemical reactions, and contribute to cellular organization. This work will provide insights for potential applications in synthetic biology and medicine.
