## Short Bio

I did my PhD at the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, between 2013 and 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Govardhan Reddy. In my doctoral research, I built computational models to investigate various aspects of protein folding thermodynamics. Before moving to UB SUNY, I worked as a postdoctoral research scholar with Prof. Dave Thirumalai at the University of Texas at Austin from January 2020 to November 2023. During this time, I have worked on low-complexity repeat RNA sequences.

Currently, I am interested in studying the various aspects of biomolecular condensates using molecular simulation techniques and statistical thermodynamic tools. In my spare time, I love watching sports and reading books.
