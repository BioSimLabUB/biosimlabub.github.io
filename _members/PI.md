## Short Bio

I got my PhD from Rutgers University in BioMaPS Institute (now the Center for Quantitative Biology), under the supervision of [Prof. David A. Case](https://casegroup.rutgers.edu). My doctoral dissertation focused on understanding the **interactions between solvent and proteins & nucleic acids**, and characterizing the *spatial distribution* of solvent around biomolecules using computational modeling and liquid state theory. This work had been done in collaboration with the group of [Prof. Lois Pollack](https://pollack.research.engineering.cornell.edu).

I then joined the group of [Prof. Dave Thirumalai](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/thirumalai) as a postdoc. There I initially worked on RNA folding, in particular the **effects of ions on RNA folding thermodynamics**. Later, I switched gear to develop computational models to understand the **phase separation behaviors of RNA**, as well as the **conformational heterogeneity and dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)**.

I joined the Department of Chemistry at the University of Buffalo as an Assistant Professor in August 2023. Check out our current [interests](/projects).
