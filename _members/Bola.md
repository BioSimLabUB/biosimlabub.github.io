## Short Bio

I completed my bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry at Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA), Ondo State, Nigeria. In 2020, I interned with HackBio Nigeria, where I researched and curated a comprehensive library of bioactive phytochemicals from the scientific literature for virtual screening against key drug targets, including the SARS-CoV and NSP9 RNA-binding protein.

At the University at Buffalo, I earned a master’s degree in Medicinal Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry and joined the BioSim Lab to deepen my understanding of the physical principles governing biomolecular condensate formation and their roles in disease progression. My research interests focus on using computational modeling and molecular simulations to study intrinsically disordered proteins and RNA-driven condensate assembly. I aim to elucidate how variations in cellular conditions regulate phase behavior, condensate function, and associated biochemical reactions.

Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking and traveling.
