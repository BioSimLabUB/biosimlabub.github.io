## Short Bio

I'm currently finishing up my freshman year, studying Computer Science and Chemistry. I find the interface of computation and experimentation fascinating. In my leisure time, I love to play basketball or go to the golf driving range to improve my skills.

Being a part of BioSim Lab provides me invaluable experience in computational modeling, specifically focusing on RNA folding. This hands-on opportunity goes beyond textbooks, allowing me to delve into the complexities of biological systems through modeling. It's a chance to bridge my studies in computer science and chemistry with real-world applications, solidifying my passion for this dynamic intersection.
