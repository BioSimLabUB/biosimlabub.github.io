<p><b>Biomolecular condensates (or membraneless organelles)</b>, comprised mostly of nucleic acids and proteins, usually form via the process of <i>phase separation</i>. Those macromolecular assemblies play extremely important roles in virtually all aspects of cellular biology: from minimizing cellular noises, regulating transcription, translation, chromatin structure and dynamics, to protein quality control, viral assembly and immune response. Importantly, dysregulation of condensate assembly or dissociation is often correlated with protein and RNA misfolding, and is indicative of the onset of various diseases, including neurodegeneration, viral infections, cardiac disease, and cancer. It is, therefore, imperative to characterize the underlying mechanisms governing the formation and dissolution of biomolecular condensates, as well as the structures and dynamics of their constituent RNAs and proteins.</p>

<p>We are <b>developing & leveraging novel theoretical & computational frameworks</b> to uncover the <i>general principles</i> regulating condensate formation, stability, structures, and properties. Such knowledge will open a new door for the engineering of new cellular functions, assist the development of novel biomaterials, as well as unlock a unique approach for advanced therapeutic interventions for many diseases. In particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the structures and dynamics of constituent RNAs and proteins in condensates</li>
  <li>Elucidate the relationship between the molecular structures, condensate composition, and its morphology & material properties</li>
  <li>Understand the effects of environmental factors on the formation and growing mechanisms of RNA-protein condensates to develop therapeutic strategies for condensate-related diseases</li>
</ul>
