We focused on understanding the <b>interactions between solvent and proteins & nucleic acids</b>, and characterizing the <b>spatial distribution of solvent around biomolecules</b>. It has been long known that both water and counterions, which carry the opposite charges to the biomolecule, accumulate at higher concentrations in the vicinity of the biomoleculeâ€™s surface. However, exactly <i>how the distribution takes shape</i> is still elusive. Using computer simulation and liquid state theory, we demonstrated that in addition to the number of ions usually measured in solution X-ray scattering or "ion counting" experiments, the <b>3-dimensional spatial distribution of solvent</b> could be obtained faithfully. The biomolecule, therefore, could be thought to carry the hydrated and ionic atmosphere around as a molecular "fingerprint". This fingerprint extends quite far away from the biomolecule surface and therefore could facilitate long-ranged molecular recognition. In addition, we have proposed a new method to <b>extract some aspects of the solvent spatial distribution</b> directly from X-ray scattering profiles, expanding the information obtainable from the experiment.
